abstract = {Recent advances in the analysis of RNA sequencing data have shown that pseudogenes are highly specific markers of cell identity and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers. Furthermore, genetically engineered mouse models have recently provided compelling support for a causal link between altered pseudogene expression and cancer. In this review, we discuss the most recent milestones reached in the pseudogene field and the use of pseudogenes as cancer classifiers.},

@article{Zheng2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pseudogenes are inheritable genetic elements showing sequence similarity to functional genes but with deleterious mutations. We describe a computational pipeline for identifying them, which in contrast to previous work explicitly uses intron-exon structure in parent genes to classify pseudogenes. We require alignments between duplicated pseudogenes and their parents to span intron-exon junctions, and this can be used to distinguish between true duplicated and processed pseudogenes (with insertions). RESULTS: Applying our approach to the ENCODE regions, we identify about 160 pseudogenes, 10{\%} of which have clear 'intron-exon' structure and are thus likely generated from recent duplications. CONCLUSION: Detailed examination of our results and comparison of our annotation with the GENCODE reference annotation demonstrate that our computation pipeline provides a good balance between identifying all pseudogenes and delineating the precise structure of duplicated genes.},
